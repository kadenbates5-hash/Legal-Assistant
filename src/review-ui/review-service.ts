/**
 * Application layer behind the attorney review-gate UI (§8 build order
 * step 5). `review-gate.ts` already guards the status-transition methods
 * (`approve`/`release`/etc. throw for a non-attorney actor), but reading
 * and listing work product is unguarded at that layer since it's meant to
 * be usable by the drafting agents that create it. This service is the
 * attorney-facing surface specifically, so every method here — including
 * plain reads — requires an attorney actor. A receptionist or paralegal
 * credential should never reach this API at all, not just be blocked on
 * the mutating calls.
