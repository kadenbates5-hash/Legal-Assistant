/**
 * Dependency-free, atomic JSON-file read/write. §8's "not yet built —
 * persistence" stopgap: everything upstream of this (core, receptionist,
 * paralegal, review-ui) operates on plain-data snapshots via each domain
 * object's `toSnapshot`/`fromSnapshot`, so swapping this for a real
 * database adapter later only means replacing this one file — nothing
 * about the snapshot shapes or the callers needs to change.
 *
 * Writes go to a temp file and are renamed into place, so a crash mid-write
 * can never leave a half-written, corrupt state file — you either get the
 * old version or the new one, never a mix.
