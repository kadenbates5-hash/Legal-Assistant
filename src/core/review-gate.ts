 * §1 non-negotiable rule: "nothing produced by either agent reaches a

 * checkpoint. The agents draft and triage; they do not finalize."
 *
 * This is implemented as an actual state machine with a guarded terminal
 * transition (`release`), not as a prompt instruction — see §8's build note
 * to keep review gates as enforced code paths.
 *
 * `flags` generalizes hard-trigger requirements like the Padilla
 * immigration-consequence advisory (§3): a practice-area module can attach
 * a flag that blocks approval until an attorney explicitly clears it.
